 ## Exercise - Variables
 
 Declare a variable `schooling` and set it to the number of years of school that you have completed. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var schooling = 16
print("Total number of years of schooling: ",schooling)
/*:
 Now imagine you just completed an additional year of school, and update the `schooling` variable accordingly. Print `schooling` to the console.
 */
var updateSchoolYr = schooling + 1
print ("Schooling years have been updated",updateSchoolYr)

/*:
 Does the above code compile? Why is this different than trying to update a constant? Print your explanation to the console using the `print` function.
 */
print("Yes the code above did compile")
print("This is different from updating a constant because using 'var' allows you to change the value")
